Exercises done in groups of three.  Incidentally [George Simmel](http://socio.ch/sim/work.htm) in early 20th century says that everything changes when you go from 1 to 2 people (a dyad), and then again going from 2 to 3 (a triad). He said that because at 3 people it's the first time you can be outvoted :) Check it out.

### Generate merge conflict

### Allow on-going development in master and branch

Working in a repository owned by *p3*. Start with a file with four animals, one per line.

```
lion
tiger
leopard
turtle
```

1. *p3* creates a new branch called `colors`, and edits the file adding a color next to animals (`lion red`).  All three are going to contribute to that branch, as well as develop in the `master` branch.
  1.1 *p3* creates new repo on github.
  1.2 *p3* clones that repo to laptop.
  1.3 *p3* creates a new file adding content above, add, commit, push.
2. *p1*, *p2*, *p3* all make contributions to master (adding more animals to the file, or changing a line.)
3. *p3* now wants to merge the `colors` branch.
  3.1 *p3* does a `pull upstream` (getting changes to `master` since creation of `colors`)
  3.2 *p3* switches to the master branch
  3.3 *p3* merges the `colors` branch into `master`, resolving any conflicts that result.
  3.4 *p3* `push` to `master`
  3.5 *p3* deletes the `colors` branch (which should then be deleted on their `origin` because it was fully merged).

### Upstream owner contributes via pull request

When you own a repository (ie you clone something other than a fork), you sometimes want to make contributions via a pull request rather than directly pushing. You do this by working with a branch.

1. *p2* creates a repository, clone it to laptop, create a file with animals in it, push it to repo.
2. *p1* and *p3* create forks.
3. *p1* and *p3* make edits (`add`, `commit`, `push`) and use pull requests to contribute changes to upstream
4. To create a PR (rather than pushing directly) *p2* creates a branch (`for-pull-request`), edits, and pushes to that branch.  Then, viewing that branch on github, *p2* can create a Pull Request from `for-pull-request` to `master`. 

### Merge branch locally

### Merge branch via Pull Request

### Tags

Your task is to create three tags, `tag-animals`, `tag-colors`, `tag-noises` which reflect the merge points of different branches.

1. Have *p3* create a repository, and start with the file having only animals.
2. *p3* tag repo with `tag-animals`
3. *p2* create a branch `colors-for-tag`. *p1* and *p3* contribute to that branch (`lion yellow`)
4. *p2* merge branch to master, than tag master as `tag-colors`.
5. *p1* create branch `noises-for-tag`. *p2* and *p3* contribute to that branch as well. (`lion yellow roar`)
6. *p1* merges that branch to master, then tag masters as `tag-noises`.

### Split a pull request

Here the scenario is that you've created a pull request but it hasn't yet been accepted. If you add additional commits to that branch then they will get added to the pull request. Remember, a pull request says, "please come to this repo and get everything on this branch". So it's not the same as puttings some commits in a zip file and mailing them, it's more like puttings things into a pigeonhole mail box and telling people to pick them up from there. So you can always add additional things before the person comes to pick them up.  This is useful because if there is a conversation around the pull request "please fix a typo or pull from upstream before we consider your pull request" then you can easily update things.

However it is an issue if you accidentally add new commits to a branch before a pull request is accepted. Now your pull request has two sets of commits: the first set and the second set. This is particularly easy to do if you are developing on the `master` branch in your fork. And it's the same scenario if you've accidentally added too many files to your pull request, something that is easy to do if you use `git add *` or some variant.

Things would be better if you had created a new branch for the first set of commits, then a second branch for your second set of commits, never adding either set to your master branch. Then each set of commits would be "sent" through a different pull request.

```
        / Branch for first set.
       /
master -
        \ 
         \ Branch for second set
```

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git init

dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ 
```

Now we can create the feature branch for the first set:

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git checkout -b first_set_branch
Switched to a new branch 'first_set_branch'
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ vi first_set_file
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git add first_set_file
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git commit -m "first set edit"
[first_set_branch d71ade9] first set edit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 first_set_file
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* d71ade9 (HEAD -> first_set_branch) first set edit
* 749454e (master) editing readme
* d5eb1e8 Adding readme
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* d71ade9 (first_set_branch) first set edit
* 749454e (HEAD -> master) editing readme
* d5eb1e8 Adding readme
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ 
```

Notice that in the git log stuff, when we are on the first branch it shows `HEAD -> first_set_branch` but when we swap back to `master` we see `(HEAD -> master)` on the second line. So there is a commit (`d71ade9`) that isn't in `master`.  Now we can create the second branch:

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git checkout -b second_set_branch
Switched to a new branch 'second_set_branch'
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ vi second_set_file
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git add second_set_file
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git commit -m "first edit in second set"
[second_set_branch 9dc0a23] first edit in second set
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 second_set_file
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* 9dc0a23 (HEAD -> second_set_branch) first edit in second set
| * d71ade9 (first_set_branch) first set edit
|/  
* 749454e (master) editing readme
* d5eb1e8 Adding readme
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ 
```
        
Now we can see that there are two branches that "come off" head after `749454e`. We can work independently, and could create pull requests for each branch separatly. Let's add a second file to the second set:

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ vi second_set_file2
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git add second_set_file2
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git commit -m "added to second set"
[second_set_branch 04d6967] added to second set
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 second_set_file2
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* 04d6967 (HEAD -> second_set_branch) added to second set
* 9dc0a23 first edit in second set
| * d71ade9 (first_set_branch) first set edit
|/  
* 749454e (master) editing readme
* d5eb1e8 Adding readme
```

And just for fun swap back to the first branch and add a second file there:

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git checkout first_set_branch 
Switched to branch 'first_set_branch'
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* 04d6967 (second_set_branch) added to second set
* 9dc0a23 first edit in second set
| * d71ade9 (HEAD -> first_set_branch) first set edit
|/  
* 749454e (master) editing readme
* d5eb1e8 Adding readme
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ vi first_set_file2
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git add first_set_file2
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git commit -m "added second file to first set"
[first_set_branch b74cb32] added second file to first set
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 first_set_file2
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git add first_set_file2
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* b74cb32 (HEAD -> first_set_branch) added second file to first set
* d71ade9 first set edit
| * 04d6967 (second_set_branch) added to second set
| * 9dc0a23 first edit in second set
|/  
* 749454e (master) editing readme
* d5eb1e8 Adding readme
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice howison$ 
```

Now the branching in this in-terminal visualization is a bit clearer.

But how do I get there from here? Ok, here's a situation where all these commits have been added on the master branch, in another repository `practice_split`. Here the commits are all piled on top of each other. If we had made a pull request after the first set of files `51f2622` but it hadn't been accepted yet then the second set of files would be added to it.

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* b5d4aff (HEAD -> master) added to second set
* dfa98b0 first edit in second set
* 43bc368 added second file to first set
* 51f2622 first set edit
* f945961 editing readme
* 367e25a Adding readme
```

So our challenge is to make this linear setup look like our branched setup above. There are a few routes we can take.  First we're going to use the ability to create a new branch from an earlier point in history. By default, of course, `git checkout -b newbranch` will branch from the current HEAD, but we can tell it to branch earlier.  So first we're going to create our two branches as though we'd done it before we started working, which is when HEAD was at `f945961`.

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git checkout -b first_set_branch f945961
Switched to a new branch 'first_set_branch'
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* b5d4aff (master) added to second set
* dfa98b0 first edit in second set
* 43bc368 added second file to first set
* 51f2622 first set edit
* f945961 (HEAD -> first_set_branch) editing readme
* 367e25a Adding readme
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ 
```

So now we can see `(HEAD -> first_set_branch)` at `f945961` as the branching point for first_set_branch. However the commits we need on that branch are not on it, we need to bring them over from `master`.  We can do that using `git cherry-pick` pointing to each of the two commits we want to bring over.

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git cherry-pick 51f2622
[first_set_branch ef2a3ee] first set edit
 Date: Tue Apr 10 17:42:47 2018 -0500
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 first_set_file
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* ef2a3ee (HEAD -> first_set_branch) first set edit
| * b5d4aff (master) added to second set
| * dfa98b0 first edit in second set
| * 43bc368 added second file to first set
| * 51f2622 first set edit
|/  
* f945961 editing readme
* 367e25a Adding readme
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git cherry-pick 43bc368
[first_set_branch 9f2b69a] added second file to first set
 Date: Tue Apr 10 17:43:07 2018 -0500
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 first_set_file2
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* 9f2b69a (HEAD -> first_set_branch) added second file to first set
* ef2a3ee first set edit
| * b5d4aff (master) added to second set
| * dfa98b0 first edit in second set
| * 43bc368 added second file to first set
| * 51f2622 first set edit
|/  
* f945961 editing readme
* 367e25a Adding readme
```

Now we can see (moving up the left) that we have a `first_set_branch` which has both of our needed commits. Note that this didn't "move" them from the `master` branch, but created new commits with the same content.  We can do the same thing to create our separate `second_set_branch`, starting by pointing back at the same branching point:

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git checkout -b second_set_branch f945961
Switched to a new branch 'second_set_branch'
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* 9f2b69a (first_set_branch) added second file to first set
* ef2a3ee first set edit
| * b5d4aff (master) added to second set
| * dfa98b0 first edit in second set
| * 43bc368 added second file to first set
| * 51f2622 first set edit
|/  
* f945961 (HEAD -> second_set_branch) editing readme
* 367e25a Adding readme
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git cherry-pick dfa98b0
[second_set_branch 0d8e90d] first edit in second set
 Date: Tue Apr 10 17:43:35 2018 -0500
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 second_set_file
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git cherry-pick b5d4aff
[second_set_branch 0841579] added to second set
 Date: Tue Apr 10 17:43:57 2018 -0500
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 second_set_file2
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* 0841579 (HEAD -> second_set_branch) added to second set
* 0d8e90d first edit in second set
| * 9f2b69a (first_set_branch) added second file to first set
| * ef2a3ee first set edit
|/  
| * b5d4aff (master) added to second set
| * dfa98b0 first edit in second set
| * 43bc368 added second file to first set
| * 51f2622 first set edit
|/  
* f945961 editing readme
* 367e25a Adding readme
```

So now we show three branches coming off at `f945961`: `master`, `first_set_branch`, and `second_set_branch`. Each of first_set_branch and second_set_branch have just the commits and files that they should:

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git branch
  first_set_branch
  master
* second_set_branch
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ ls
README           second_set_file  second_set_file2
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ git checkout first_set_branch 
Switched to branch 'first_set_branch'
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ ls
README          first_set_file  first_set_file2
```

So now if we create pull requests from each of those branches, they'll contain just the content we wanted in each of them. Hurray.

Now we just have to consider what to do about the additional commits on `master`.  This is going to depend on a few things. Do you have additional commits on `master` that you haven't distributed among new branches? Do you want `master` to exactly reflect the history of `master` on `upstream`? How tolerant are you of "messy history"?  It's also going to depend on whether `master` had been pushed up and whether others might have built on top of it.

Here are many options, here are two:

1. Revert the commits that you "moved" to the branches.  `git revert` creates "opposite" commits, that undo any changes. So if you lay a revert commit on top of a commit then the content is as though the commit was never made.
2. Create a new branch from your branching point, then rename it to `master`, orphaning your current master.

#### Using revert

First I created a copy of the repo, so I could show both options.

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split howison$ cd ..
dhcp-10-157-4-224:PeerProduction howison$ cp -r practice_split practice_split_revert
dhcp-10-157-4-224:PeerProduction howison$ cd practice_split_revert/
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split_revert howison$ git branch
* first_set_branch
  master
  second_set_branch
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split_revert howison$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split_revert howison$ git branch
  first_set_branch
* master
  second_set_branch
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split_revert howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* 0841579 (second_set_branch) added to second set
* 0d8e90d first edit in second set
| * 9f2b69a (first_set_branch) added second file to first set
| * ef2a3ee first set edit
|/  
| * b5d4aff (HEAD -> master) added to second set
| * dfa98b0 first edit in second set
| * 43bc368 added second file to first set
| * 51f2622 first set edit
|/  
* f945961 editing readme
* 367e25a Adding readme
```

Then I used a range expression (the `..`) with revert to revert the set of four commits on `master`. Note that the double dot range syntax used like this is left exclusive (ie you have to go back one further than the first you want.)  I also had to provide four commit messages, one for each of the reverting commits. 

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split_revert howison$ git revert f945961..b5d4aff
[master afcee46] Revert "added to second set"
 1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)

dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split_revert howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color

* dfa98b0 first edit in second set
* 43bc368 added second file to first set
* 51f2622 first set edit
| * 0841579 (second_set_branch) added to second set
| * 0d8e90d first edit in second set
|/  
| * 9f2b69a (first_set_branch) added second file to first set
| * ef2a3ee first set edit
|/  
* f945961 editing readme
* 367e25a Adding readme
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split_revert howison$ ls
README
```

#### git reset --hard

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:PeerProduction howison$ cp -r practice_split practice_split_reset_master
dhcp-10-157-4-224:PeerProduction howison$ cd practice_split_reset_master/
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split_reset_master howison$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split_reset_master howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* 0841579 (second_set_branch) added to second set
* 0d8e90d first edit in second set
| * 9f2b69a (first_set_branch) added second file to first set
| * ef2a3ee first set edit
|/  
| * b5d4aff (HEAD -> master) added to second set
| * dfa98b0 first edit in second set
| * 43bc368 added second file to first set
| * 51f2622 first set edit
|/  
* f945961 editing readme
* 367e25a Adding readme
```

Now we use `git reset --hard` to force HEAD back to `f945961`. That disconnects the four unwanted commits (I *think* they aren't actually gone from .git folder yet, but they could be deleted any time as they aren't connected to anything.).

```
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split_reset_master howison$ git reset --hard f945961
HEAD is now at f945961 editing readme
dhcp-10-157-4-224:practice_split_reset_master howison$ git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color
* 0841579 (second_set_branch) added to second set
* 0d8e90d first edit in second set
| * 9f2b69a (first_set_branch) added second file to first set
| * ef2a3ee first set edit
|/  
* f945961 (HEAD -> master) editing readme
* 367e25a Adding readme
```

That seems neater, but keep in mind that if you'd pushed `master` to github while those commits were there, anyone else who had built on your repo would have lots of trouble.  The `revert` approach goes for messier history, but has the advantage that it doesn't disconnect anyone else.

## Rebase examples

When one is working on a problem, others may be working in parallel. And their parallel work may be finished before one's own work is. Thus the starting point for one person's work (branching point) can "go stale" making it harder to integrate. While `git merge` and resolving syntax level conflicts can resolve some of this, it is often easier to understand and review work if it is presented as changes against an updated starting point. 

As a concrete example imagine a project to build a dashboard. Imagine that you fork the repo in January to implement a new type of visualization (let's say a pie chart). You work on this during January and February, finally nailing it down at the start of March.  Meanwhile, though, others in the project have spent February replacing the database infrastructure, introducing a new way of accessing databases. By the time you make a pull request at the start of March things have changed a lot since you branched in January. The developers ask you to update your branch to make it work with the new database system.

```
--January-|------February--------------|--March

```

Two options: 

1. either merge master into pie_chart_branch your self
2. rebase pie_chart_branch on master (as though pie_chart_branch was created in late February)

Q: is rebase just about avoiding merge commits in the log?
