# Peer Production Adaption to the industry of Foreign Language Learning
## Introduction
For a long time, foreign language learning was considered as an affiliate of the industry of education. Education, for a long time, was considered as a traditional industry where the theory of peer production was not accepted as effective.  
In tradition, there're only two types of language learning:
1. Taking courses in any kinds of educational institutions, including middle schools, universities, third-party language schools, online courses, etc.
2. Self-learning with some teaching resources like textbooks. May include helps from friends who are native speakers.

Both methods have their advantages. However, some limitations restricted the development of language learning.  
## Limitations
For the most typical method -- opening classes teaching foreign languages, it has a strict requirement on the qualifications of the teachers. Good teachers, especially those who teach a language that is not very popular, may be scarce resources for some regions, while in other regions the relationship of supply and demand was inverted -- few people are willing to learn a language so the teachers are unable to open classes. Another problem is that except for the voluntary courses, most language study courses are fairly expensive. In China, the average hour's rate for taking an English class can be about one hundred yuan(about 16 dollars). And for online courses, on italki.com[1], a 1-on-1 language teaching platform, hours rate ranges from $4 to $80. Obviously, not everybody can afford such courses.  

For the self-learner, the learning process is usually tough. One of the most cons that may influence the passion to learn by oneself is the lack of interaction. During self-learning, one may not be able to evaluate the effect of his/her learning. Unless in a class, he/she may feel difficult to find a partner to communicate, discuss questions and do interactive practices. The result is lacking self-assessment. Although the learner can revise the textbook from time to time, he/she may not know exactly whether the knowledge has been grasped. Many self-learners will abandon halfway.


## Efforts for Adaption to Peer Production
In recent years, The concept of Peer Production was gradually introduced into the industry of education.  

Benkler[2] describes Peer production as:  
> "Peer production is the most significant organizational innovation that has emerged from Internet-mediated social practice.Organizationally, it combines three core characteristics: (a) decentralization of conception and execution of problems and solutions, (b) harnessing diverse motivations, and (c) separation of governance and management from property and contract. Functionally, these components make peer production practices highly adept at learning and experimentation, innovation, and adaptation in rapidly changing, persistently uncertain and complex environments."

Peer production emerged from software development, but there're attempts about language learning in peers.  
In 2000, Vick et al.[3] design and implement a series of collaborative Japanese language-learning sessions conducted via the Internet. In the virtual classroom, Japanese and American students meet online doing dialogues in peers, and the result of the study shows peer production "enhance team memory, sustain workflow processes, and employ user/learner models".  
In 2011, Kim et al.[4] discuss using online Information and Communication Technologies(ICT)-based feedback tools to help teachers review students' Chinese writings.  
Li[5] studied how adult English-as-foreign-language(EFL) learners interact with each other in learning target form in collaborative task performance.  
Angelova et al.[6] researched and made strategies of the children’s mediation of their own and each other’s language learning within and across languages in peers in a Spanish/English dual language first-grade classroom.

Moreover, some language learning websites and phone applications are developed based on the theory of peer production. Some examples are HiNative and HelloTalk.  
HiNative is designed to let users provide answers to the translation of languages. Every user will be registered as the native speaker of one or more languages. Then they can answer questions like "how to say 'Good morning' in Chinese?" if these speak Chinese. In turn, they can ask questions about the expression of any languages they are learning.   
Similarly, HelloTalk is designed as platforms for language learners to help correct grammar errors with each other. Every user has one or more native languages and can choose one or more foreign languages that he or she wants to learn. Then, the user can provide some sorts of contents with the targeted language(article, audio); after releasing the content, any other users who speak this language can offer the correction to the content if any grammar mistakes or other errors occur. The user can, in turn, contribute to others' content.   

## An Interview with a participant
I, myself, was a user of Hinative two years ago, and I know this application because of the invitation from one of my classmates, Mr. Wang. So when I'm doing this project, I remember him and managed to let him be the interviewee of this interview. I asked him several questions about his user experience with HiNative, as well as his evaluation on it. The interview was taken via online chat using Chinese, I recorded it and translated it into English. Below is part of the contents of this interview("Q" means questions, A means answers):  
> Q: When did you start using HiNative? Where did you hear it from?  
> A: _It's in 2014. I just graduated from high school, started college life. I was planning to go abroad for exchange in a few years. I want to practice my English, although I have studied it for more than ten years.I occasionally found a website called lang-8.com(note by the author: it's an online platform with similar functions like HiNative) and used it for a while. Then I started to look for a phone app that has such functions so I can use it more conveniently. That how I found HiNative._  

> Q: Do you think Hinative is a kind of peer production?  
> A:_I'm not familiar with this term. But from your explanation(Note by the author: I briefly explained this term to him), it can be considered. Although not exactly like Wikipedia, it's a collaborative app where you benefit from the contents of the app and contributes to it as well._

> Q: How do you feel about it?  
> A:_Generally speaking, it's good. For me, I was learning English while I was also interested in Japenese. For English, as I was preparing the CET Test(Note by the author: a national English test in China), I uploaded some of my exercises of writing materials. And most of them got feedbacks. Basically corrections on the details since I already had the basis of English grammars and vocabulary. For Japanese, since I was a beginner, I can only upload some simple greeting terms. And the feedbacks are reasonably poor._


> Q: What do you think caused the bad feedbacks of Japanese learning?  
> A:_Since I didn't know much about Japanese, I didn't have many choices of different contents to upload. So there're basically no errors for others to find._


> Q: What's the biggest advantage of HiNative? The defection?  
> A:_First, it's free. Then it's convenient. I can upload texts in my spare time and got the reply in a few hours. Defections...The app does have many defections. Like, you can't make sure the corrections made by others are the right answer. And sometimes your posts got no reply, which is awkward. I gave it up later._


> Q: You don't use it anymore? Why?  
> A: _Yes. I don't know why... It's good, but after not more than two months I started to forget its existence and one day, I deleted it... Maybe an important factor is that to get more attention so that your post can get the correction, you must be "socially active", making more friends. I think this is not what I am looking for in this app._


> Q: Can you evaluate it in a few words?  
> A: _It's a good application to help you improve a language, but the premise is you have some level of fundament. You cannot rely on it to learn a language from scratch. It cannot replace textbooks nor classes._

## Challenges
Obviously, although some breakthroughs have been made, peer production in language learning still face many challenges. Peer production is popular in software development for some reasons. In the field software development, many users are software developers as well. Many of them pursue the spirit of open source and have the passion and skills to contribute to some software they are using. And some powerful tools like Git and Github allow them to do peer production in convenience freely.

By contrast, language learning is still struggling with some of its limitations.   
First, unlike software development where products are created, in language learning, the production is abstract. Contributors to peer language teaching may not be sure about whether their efforts can be effective.   
Besides, teaching is not just about grasping a language and deliver it to others. A teacher should acquire some teaching skills like good communication, teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, conclude common difficulties of knowledge, and so on. Once lacking in such abilities, a person may be incapable to teach others, thus lose the basis of peer production in language learning.  
The external environment also restricts the development of peer production. Although there have been many peer production applications in language learning available on market, as I have introduced, they on average have only userbases in millions, while the total market demand in billions. Traditional teaching mode is still competitive. And the spirit of open source isn't a very popular concept in education. Many teachers don't have the demand to learn another language so they are unwilling to contribute without reward. And vice versa.

According to the interview, we can also find some problems of peer production. Like Mr. Wang mentioned, he gave up using HiNative only several months later. Although this new kind of learning mode is interesting, the effect in practice of learning may not be that good. To learn a language on the app, you may first teach others to get enough attention, which will be time-consuming; you may not be sure whether the corrections made by others are the right answers. After all, not all of the users have the qualifications of teaching languages.
## Conclusion
From the past decade, the field of language learning has made some attempts to implement peer production as an alternative to the traditional mode of teaching classes. Some researches are made to analyze the strategies of peer production, and some software and mobile applications are developed with the concept of peer production. They all more or less achieved some successes.

However, Peer production is still not the mainstream of language learning. Some people are unwilling to contribute without rewards, and others may lack necessary skills to teach others in an interactive way. Traditional teaching mode is still competitive, and there lack worldwide powerful tools like Github to help people with peer production in this field.  

But we can look into the future that peer production in language learning should have bright prospects since it has a huge potential userbase since there're billions of people having the demand of learning a new language in some convenient ways.
