# How Far Can Mappers Go along the Open Source Way? A Brief Look at OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap(OSM) is an initiative to create and provide free geographic data, such as street maps, to anyone [(OpenStreetMap Foundation, 2017)][2]. Inspired by Wikipedia and the predominance of proprietary map data, OSM is created in the UK in 2004 [(“OpenStreetMap”, Wikipedia)][3] and addresses itself as “the Free Wiki World Map” [(OpenStreetMap Forum, n.d.)][4]. As an editable open data common, it now has over two million worldwide users as an active community of mappers that voluntarily contribute and maintain geographic information on OSM. As a knowledge production community, OSM has mobilized a large, geographically dispersed population of users to work toward a shared database. In the following section, the contribution and organization process of this productive enterprise will be uncovered to demonstrate the hybrid collaborative style of OSM.
##	Why do people use OSM?
The whole story starts at the first-time engagement in the OSM by individual users. Surely it can be plenty of fun to create and edit a web map, but OSM is primarily an open, rich geodata source and supports various uses. For instance, users can download geospatial data or maps, display them on their own websites, use them in GPS devices or as raw materials for creative work.  Free editing is allowed so users can tailor and edit the map data for their own ends. An intuitive example from daily practice could be that the author uses OSM to mark her favorite cafes on OSM. In essence, OSM serves as a relatively plain base map and gets further enriched by user-generated map content. These contents include observed geographic features, like locations, rivers, roads, buildings, shops, amenities, transport, etc. and multidimensional information about their attributes. OSM claims data collection through such collective efforts leads to better accuracy. Contrast with map data from public domain or commercial sources, newly crowd-collected geographic information is more updated and free of intentional distortion created by original author in case of copyright disputes [(“Why OpenStreetMap?”, OpenStreetMap Wiki)][5].

According to a long-term OSM user, many people use OSM for research purposes. Academics from various disciplinary backgrounds, like archeology, architecture, history, geology, and civil engineering, etc., come to OSM for the use value of its map data. As the observed result, the OSM user community also consists of GIS professionals, enthusiasts of special interests like hikers and cyclists, humanitarians mapping disaster-affected areas, as well as businesses and government agencies. Many of their motivations for using and editing map data are self-directed, or rooted in the instrumental value [(Deci & Ryan, 2000)][6], while some humanitarian mappers may be involved in crisis mapping practice out of altruism. The interviewed user also did not deny that there are hobbyists who purely enjoy the fun of playing with editable web maps.  It seems safe to claim that OSM users have varied motivations, ranging from intrinsic to extrinsic, from nonmonetary to monetary, from individual to collective ones. This is conducive to bind a large, heterogeneous population with diverse expertise and thus could increase the power of the collaboration [(Benkler, 2016)][1].

Here two ingredients of a peer production model are identified: an open common which allows diverse people equally access resources without transaction, and participation largely based on individual motivations without the omission of collective ones.

##	How to contribute?
The openness and utility of OSM's geodata attract global users to join the collaborative production of more data. Their contribution to the dataset is three-way: to add and modify geographic information online using editing software, to upload GPS tracks of one’s location change to improve the accuracy of geodata, and to import third-party open-licensed datasets into the database.

Though these data input practices are pre-determined by OSM and seem losing the undefined task structure of the usual peer production model [(Benkler, 2016)][1], the data contribution process is still marked with high uncertainty and requires skills and creativity. Contributors need to familiarize themselves with the use of editing software among dozens of options across different operating systems; they collect geographic information on the ground or online, creatively adopting various sets of digital devices, objects, and data sources. Indeed, OSM is an experimental space calling for resourcefulness and ingenuity to navigate and produce knowledge. In this sense, it still shares the knowledge-intensive and innovative flavor of peer production [(Benkler, 2016][1]).

As a production environment, OSM shares many features of other hosting services like Github. OSM gives sufficient visibility to users' editing history and organizes them in small episodes. In OSM's parlance, these are called changesets. A changeset is a group of edits made by a single user over a short period of time. It can be closed by the user or itself with more than an hour of inactivity [(“Changeset”, OpenStreetMap Wiki)][7]. When a user has made inappropriate edits, she/he can always delete the single edit or undo an entire changeset via revert scripts [(“Changeset Rollback”, OpenStreetMap Wiki)][8]. The explicit history and the ability to rewind edits and changesets on OSM have two main advantages: first, it permits other users to review the data change and efficiently locate the problem in certain episode of history; second, it turns easy the identification and modification of a problematic set of changes, which is usually the case of vandalism. The traceability and rewindability of the past work are also indispensable conditions in the FLOSS model of organizing [(Howison, 2009)][9]. In OSM, these conditions at least have some positive effect on the quality of production, experienced by the author when she once realized one of her previous edits was not the best practice so she deleted and substituted it with more appropriate information.

##	Once the work is done
Not only OSM is an open common *per se*, its technology infrastructure also consists of a wide array of open source tools. What pushes OSM another step further on “the open source way” is its licensing. OSM uses two types of licenses: the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) by the OpenStreetMap Foundation and the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 (CC-BY-SA) [("License/Licence and Legal FAQ", OpenStreetMap Foundation)][10]. Both licenses are copylefts which require the redistribution of derivative work under the same license. They deal with different formats of work and this is related to the rich forms of geographic data as raw materials. Geographic data can be spatial data or attribute data, or image files that constitute web map tiles. If people use the former and produce datasets, they would want to use ODbL; if they use map tiles, for instance, in the production of video or computer games, like what Pokémon Go does, a CC-BY-SA 2.0 would better suits the creative work.

The diversified types of derivative products also build on OSM in different ways. The derivative datasets could return to the common of OSM, if compatible; while the produced creative work sometimes become publicity and bring new users from different fields to the community. The heterogeneity of the OSM geographic information objects is crucial to understanding whether the indispensable conditions in the open superposition model of collaboration for community-based FLOSS projects are still fitting and functioning in OSM ([Howison, 2009][9]; [Howison, 2014][13]). The material characteristics of software and digital maps are *prima facie* very similar: they are both layerable. However, the layers of digital maps are different modes of displaying information at the frontend, while the layering of code is the characteristic of the production process. By contrast, the production of geodata is not through layering or rather an accumulative process. Those map edits, uploads, and imports are “deposited” on the database by bits, leave along the fact that not every chunk of data is necessarily functional to users. But the display logic of map data has its own affordance: the map tiles are joined together by individually requested image files over the Internet. This allows the segmentation and parallel use of maps across websites, and hypothetically opens up the possibility of creating distributed workspace.
##	How to collaborate?
OSM has a quite full-fledged communication infrastructure that brings its community together in diverse channels: more than one hundred mail lists concerning assorted topics or connecting different groups of users, region-, language-, or topic-specific forums, community wiki with talk pages, a Q&A site, realtime text chat channels (IRC), user diaries and community blogs with comment boxes, private messaging services within the site, and peripheral social networking channels. More notable is the immediate communication around its key content: the changeset discussion. As questions and problems always emerge with the editing practice and it was often difficult to discuss changesets [(OpenStreetMap Blog, 2014)][11], OSM team introduced this feature to facilitate more collaborative production. An individual user can subscribe to the thread of any changeset, for example, a changeset made by the user, so she/he will be notified when someone comments on the changeset, and a discussion can begin. This feature brings the workspace and the discussion space within the same screen and raises more collaborative possibility to the opportunistic exposure of the content change to potential immediate collaborators [(Howison, 2009)][9], as the following screenshot illustrates. These discussions are not always problem-centered, sometimes can be random chats as observed.

In the toolbox of OSM, collaborative software and coordinating tools also give rise to more self-organizing dynamics. Among an extensive collection of tools and bots executing various tasks like bug reporting, error detection, change monitoring, editing assistance, etc., the OSM Task Manager is known as a successful one in the OSM community. This tool is designed to divide up a mapping job into smaller tasks, distribute them to numerous mappers and track the working progress [(“OSM Task Manager”, OpenStreetMap Wiki)][12]. A validation procedure of edits which requires three participants to check the quality of a single contribution is also programmed into the software. On the OSM Task Manager, usually organizations launch their collaborative mapping projects with pre-set task conceptualization and work breakdowns. The contributions of individual mappers are crowdsourced via the platform. Let us step back and visualize the whole picture: the job design on OSM is actualized in a semi-automated manner. Within the technology infrastructure of OSM, the task conceptualization and execution are completed through both algorithmic and human coordination processes. This hybrid decentralization of work in OSM touches the core of peer production but with a subtly different taste.

With an open data common, a large number of global contributors with diverse motivations and licenses that help preserve them, the distinct way of presenting and producing geographic data, and myriad communication channels and working technologies that allow differing ways of organizing decentralized and distributed work, OSM operates much like a large-scale international organization in the real world: with its workshops and team members scattered around the world, nested communities with differentiated goals, serious discussions and chitchats both out of band and between episodes of work, etc. It cannot be explained through one single model of collaboration but reifies an intricate sociotechnical system burgeoning from an open source database, boosted by the multiplex technology infrastructure.
