## Introduction

The peer prodcution work I am going to discuss in this paper is Google Play Store(Figure 1-1). It is one of the most common applications in people`s phones. Nowadays, people (who use Android phones) are used to downloading APPs for education, entertainment, communication and consumption on this application. Besides, application developers are able to upload, manage and update their work with legal licenses. 

Google Play Store( or  Google Play) is a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google. It serves as the official app store for the Android operating system, allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the Android software development kit (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a digital media store, offering music, magazines, books, movies, and television programs.

Google states in its Developer Policy Center that "Google Play supports a variety of monetization strategies to benefit developers and users, including paid distribution, in-app products, subscriptions, and ad-based models", and requires developers to comply with the policies in order to "ensure the best user experience". It requires that developers charging with apps and downloads through Google Play must use Google Play's payment system. 

Google Play is definitely a user-friendly application. Searching for a specific application is easy, so is looking for some applications that you might be interested, as there are a lot of applications displayed on the homepage. And there are thousands of new applications been uploaded (or updated) in Google play. It is a perfect platform both for users and for developers, the former is able to get almost what they want, and the later can show off their designing or coding skill here, as well as earn money and fame here. 

## Collaboration Infrastructure 

Android developers are peer producers of Google Play. It stores offers a convenient procedure for developers putting their APPs on shelf. All you need is an account, and a well-developed application. 

Firstly, you need to enter some necessary information about your application, such as introduction, privacy authorization and price. And then you should make sure the application you are going to upload is not a beta version, as we always use a beta version in development, get the APP ready for alpha, beta or internal test. This procedure is called “release”, after reviewing and preparing for release, you would be sure about there are no bugs in your work. The next step is managing APK files, Package names for app files are unique and permanent, so please name them carefully. Package names can't be deleted or re-used in the future. One thing you should be aware of is the limit size of uploading or updating files, so if one single file exceeds the limit, you have separate them into multiple files then upload them together. Besides, a certificate is also required before uploading or updating. Another thing should be cared about is version code, Google Play restricts that version code cannot exceed 200000000, if your version code is larger than this number, your request of uploading or updating an application would be rejected. And before releasing a new version, you should inform customers about the oldest Android version it supports. 

Besides the things you should double-check of your application, you should also do some work to make your development more “readable” in Goolge Play. You should provide product details, such as title, short description and full description. And provide some snapshots, or picture information, to make the application more attractive. Google play also offers an intimate service that can translate your introduction or pictures into other languages. Then select which category the application should belong to, this would expose it to more patient target users. And do not forget to add your contact information for uses to report bugs. Privacy policy is also a must before users get into the APP.

In this way, developers are able to upload or update their works in Google Play Store. This is why there are thousands of new APPs in Google Play every day. Google Play allows every developer to take part in collaborating this platform, and this is its collaboration infrastructure.   

## Peer Production

According to Benkler, peer production combines three core characteristics: (a) decentralization of conception and execution of problems and solutions, (b) harnessing diverse motivations, and (c) separation of governance and management from property and contract.

Firstly, as for decentralization, Google Play is a platform and forum for all developers worldwide. In tradition development, applications went along with devices, that is, a single device can only have the initial applications, no more extra applications can be downloaded. So software engineers of devices are the only persons who can do development. But now, every software developer with a license can release their work for various devices. 

Secondly about motivations, application developers have various motivation. The most common motivation is gaining profit, for those developers working in profit-making company, the reason why they release new versions of applications is making money for their employer, one example for is mobile game applications, users usually tend to spend money to make themselves rank higher. Another motivation is education. Once upon a time I have been recommended an application “Painting of Lady of Guo Country on a Spring Outing”, it introduced people`s lives in The Palace in Tang Dynasty, the figures were so exquisite and the explanation was so explicit that I thought it should be charged, so this is an example of education. Another common motivation is interest, there are some students fond of coding, so maybe some of them would develop applications and upload them on Google Play.

Thirdly, as for governance and management, the main responsibility to govern and manage is not Google play\`s, it is developers` duty to manage their own applications, they only use Google Play as a platform. And take the traditional development example mentioned above, the copyright of applications built in a devise belongs to the devise company, so the company has duty of governance and management. The devise is not only a platform, but also a collection of initial applications.

Because of these reasons, I think Google Play Store is a great example of peer production.

## Challenge

I think there are mainly two factors that challenge Google Play and its peer production pattern, they are higher and higher application price, competition with other platform, competition between famous applications and unknown ones.

As for price, the overall price of applications become higher and higher these years. Although it would not affect die-hard fans` faith in these applications, it silently raised the threshold for new users.

Besides, there exists competition between Google Play and other application platforms in various Android devices. Take HUA WEI phone for example, there is HUA WEI APP store in it, and it contains almost all the applications Google Play provide. Because of this, some users prefer to use the build-in APP store, as it sounds more “considerable” for them. And for the users who are using lower version of Android, the build-in APP store is able to select proper applications to fit their system.

In this ranking list of Google Play, “all APPs are born equal” definitely does not work. If unfortunately, a new game and a new version of HearthStone release at the same day, the new game is almost impossible to rank higher than HearthStone, and further affect peer production environment in Google Play. With this ranking pattern, I\`m afraid it would affect small company developers` motivation, after all people would except a game from Blizzard more than a game from nowhere.

## Interview

I designed two surveys for users and developers separately. The one for users focuses on their user experience, and what benefit do they get from this peer production pattern. The one for developers focuses on their experience, what do they think about the peer production pattern, and difficulty they encounter when uploading or updating applications.

Here is the simplified interview records:

The interview for users:

- **How often do you use Google play store, and how do you like it?**

Answer: There is no specific frequency of using it, it is like when someone recommends me an APP, I would lookup it on Google Play, or when I think I need something new, say, a mobile game, I would look at “ Top Chart” of games, and select one of them that interests me. 

I think Google Play is pretty convenient. I am able to know what game is fashionable (even if I have no enough money to buy it). And when a new version of an existing APP is released, I can be informed of that. When I change a devise, the applications in my old phone can be found in Google Play, I do not need to pay for them again!

- **What benefit do you get from this peer production pattern? ( After explaining peer production)**

Answer: I can get access to various APPs from both big-title company and small company equally, and there are new applications everyday.

The interview for Android developers:

- **Have you experience in upload new APPs on Google Play? And how do you like it? Have you encounter any difficulty in this process?**

Answer: Of course I have. I the beginning is thought this procedure is verbose, as you need you pay for an account, get a license, write a lot of descriptions, and check a lot of things. But now I think they are all necessary steps, as we need to make sure our users can install and use them, and in this way we can manage the versions properly.

About difficulty, once upon a time I released beta version, that was really awkward. So after time I would double check the version.

- **What do you think about the peer production pattern?**

Answer: Thanks to software development and peer production, thousands and thousands of start-ups gain a lot of profit nowadays. Without the peer production pattern on Google Play, the APP we design and develop would not be known by a lot of people, there would be no  platform for our APP to display. With peer production, we can be one of the contributors of Google Play.  

## Conclusion

This paper mainly talks about what Google Play is, and how it works to accomplish its peer production pattern. Later I talked about what steps developers should do to be one of contributors of Google Play. In Peer Production part, I state what criteria it meets to be a peer production project. Then I analyze some challenge Google Play might meet from my point of view. In the end, I put a report of two interviews here, they are interview for a user and a developer separately, and we discussed about the benefit of peer production.
