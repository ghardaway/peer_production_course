INF385T - Peer Production  

# Peer Production Adaptation Paper – YouTube  

## Introduction  
One of the core tenets of peer production is depending on the contributions of volunteers to effectively create, modify, or improve a project (Tapscott & Williams, 2006). The reliance on volunteers has been successfully adapted to various other platforms online that otherwise do not fit into the peer production mold. Websites like Yelp, SoundCloud, and Kickstarter thrive on volunteer-based, user-generated content to draw new users to their platform. One of the most popular platforms that integrates the volunteer mindset of peer production is YouTube. While not strictly fitting the traditional definition of peer production, YouTube has adapted this foundational aspect of the peer production model by relying on volunteers to provide the majority of the content on the platform.

## What is YouTube?  
YouTube is a video uploading and sharing website founded in 2005 by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawad Karim. After the initial success of the platform, the company was acquired by Google in 2006 (Hussain, 2015). YouTube is immensely popular with over a billion users and a billion hours of content viewed daily (Youtube, 2018f). YouTube’s content consists of a massive variety of videos whose range of topics are virtually limitless.  

The core principle of YouTube is that anyone can contribute to the platform by uploading their video to the website (YouTube, 2018a). YouTube is not a carefully curated set of videos that are chosen by a trained group of editors. It is a sprawling, massive construction of users’ uploaded content. The company relies upon their massive collection of volunteer video uploaders to generate new, popular videos that lead to ad-revenue (Hussain, 2015). One could think of it as a free, online television service that provides an overwhelming amount of channels.  

Anyone can start a YouTube account for free and start their own “channel” to upload videos. The popularity of a channel is dependent on the number of subscribers the user has accumulated. Similar to followers on Twitter, subscribers are anyone with a YouTube account that chooses to receive notifications from a YouTuber’s channel when a new video is uploaded (YouTube, 2018c). The popularity of the platform has created YouTube “celebrities” that have millions of subscribers. For example, Swedish YouTuber Felix Jones (known as PewDiePie) has by far the most popular channel on the platform with over sixty million subscribers (Lynch, 2018).

## Barriers to Contributing  
Much like peer production, a challenge faced by new participants is the initial confusion of how to correctly contribute the platform (Lee, Carver, & Bosu, 2017). During my interview with Luke Harwerth from the small YouTube channel TwinSauce (see Appendix), he mentioned this learning curve when starting out as a YouTube creator. He mentioned that common barriers include knowing what type of equipment to use when recording, how to properly edit videos, and how to make content that is successful on the platform. While listing these challenges, he emphasized that, due to his desire to join the community, he was motivated to overcome these challenges.

## Motivations for Uploading  
Based upon my interview with Luke (see Appendix), his motivations for contributing to YouTube started out as purely intrinsic, but they slowly became enmeshed with extrinsic motivations as he progressed. When asked about his initial motivations for joining YouTube, Luke stated that he was a fan of the platform and wanted to participate in the community that he enjoyed. He began uploading content for fun. As he continued uploading videos, his motivations became more focused on gaining a following and making YouTube his full-time job. Currently, from a collective four hundred thousand views spread across all of his nearly nine hundred uploads (YouTube, n.d.-c), he makes little to no money from his videos. Despite this lack of income, the potential for success on the platform leads him to continue to upload reguarly.  

Luke emphasized the importance of the social connections that he has developed on the platform. Like peer production, a connection to the platform’s community is an important motivation for being a part of YouTube (Lee, Carver, & Bosu, 2017). Especially for new members, the presence of a responsive, helpful community that encourages one to contribute is extremely beneficial. To help deepen these relationships, YouTube creators can meet each other in person at popular member-focued events like VidCon. Similar, relationship-building conferences are held for peer production communities such as Hackfests or project hosted events (Fogel, 2018). Yet, unlike most peer production communities, YouTube itself is structured like a social media website. Therefore, the social nature of the website may make the community aspect occur more naturally than a standard peer production project.  

The allure of riches can be a powerful motivation for aspiring YouTube creators. The most popular YouTubers make remarkable amounts of money through their videos, brand deals, merchandise, and tours. In 2017, the highest paid YouTuber grossed nearly seventeen million dollars (BBC, 2017). Yet, per YouTube’s terms on video monetization, small YouTube channels with low viewer counts do not make any money from their videos (YouTube, 2018d). Therefore, while money may be the end goal of starting a channel, a user will not be making money right away and is never guaranteed to become successful.  

## Collaboration on YouTube  
Unlike most major peer production projects, inter-volunteer collaboration is not a key element of YouTube functioning efficiently. Where a peer production project relies on volunteers to edit, improve, and monitor many aspects of a project (Tapscott & Williams, 2006), YouTube creators work independently on their own channel and do not necessarily have to worry about the expectations or standards of other content creators. As a result, YouTubers have more freedom than a typical peer production volunteer to create any type of content they desire within the platform. In some cases, YouTube channels collaborate by creating a video together and, hopefully, generate more views by combining the interest of both of their sets of subscribers (YouTube, 2018b). A popular example of this type of content is the collaboration videos of the comedy channels h3h3productions and iDubbzTV (h3h3productions, 2016).  

## Creative “Branching” on YouTube  
On a creative level, a peer production-like form of creation does occur on YouTube with the creation of remix videos. For instance, a small clip from the Cartoon Network show Adventure Time called “Adventure Time – Bacon Pancakes” was uploaded to YouTube (khalob1, 2012). A few months later, a remixed song version of the clip titled “Adventure Time – Bacon Pancakes – New York remix” was uploaded by another YouTube channel. This remix was massively popular and currently stands at nearly nine million views (jpattyb, 2012). This process could be compared to a peer production participant branching off from a project and creating their own version of it. Albeit, it is harder to track the progression of a YouTube “branch” because it is not connected to the original project unless the uploader provides credit to the original video.  

## Governance  
As a subsidiary of Google, YouTube’s governance does not fit into the traditional governance models of peer production. Their management mostly consists of negotiating advertising deals and moderating content (Warner, Espinoza, & Aquino, 2018). As Luke pointed out during our interview (see Appendix), the administration makes their major decisions without the input of the content creators. As a result, YouTube’s governance fits into the autocratic style of a more traditional company model. 

A major function of YouTube’s governance is to delegate the moderation of content that is uploaded to the platform. Content that is inappropriate according to the platform’s community guidelines can be taken down by official YouTube moderators (Kuchler, 2017). To help alleviate the burden for these employees, users can also flag content that they deem breaks the community guidelines or infringes on copyright law. While flagging does not always lead to the removal of a video, it can cause the video to stop generating ad-revenue for the channel by having all of the ads taken off of the video (YouTube, 2018e). The flagging option is similar to Wikipedia’s “tagging” feature that notifies editors of an issue ("Wikipedia: Tagging," n.d.).  

## User-Management Controversy  
There have been multiple complaints from YouTubers that the management is unclear in their approval of ad-worthy content. This conflict creates friction between popular YouTubers and the management. These disputes between management and YouTubers over this issue have been popularized within the larger YouTube community through analysis videos like on the news channel Philip DeFranco (2017). This conflict is comparable to the governance of a peer produced project that is overly controlling and lacks communication with its volunteer base (Shah, 2006). 

Luke of TwinSauce voiced his discontent with the administration (see Appendix). He stated that, as a channel with a small subscriber base, the platform mostly ignores them. As a result, he feels like he has little control over how the content is handled on the platform. While he understands that they are a business, he wishes that the management cared more for the needs of the content creators instead of only the monetary gain.  

In peer production, the creation of a new project based off of a branch of the original project could possibly remedy this governance issue. Yet, with large amounts of money involved, this issue becomes more complex on YouTube. While YouTubers have the ability to switch platforms to host their videos, these alternatives lack the user-base to attract the massive amount of viewers and subsequent income that YouTube can generate. As Luke mentioned (see Appendix), competitors like Twitch (a popular video streaming website) have risen to the challenge of over-taking YouTube’s popularity, but they have not yet achieved the same level of success.

## Diversity on YouTube  
Unlike many peer production projects, YouTube is not a male-dominated platform with a 2015 survey of YouTube reporting that 49% of users were female (Adweek, 2015). Still, in 2017, out of the top ten highest earning channels, all but one channel was run by a man (BBC, 2017). This situation could be due to the popularity of gaming channels which are primarily viewed by men (Statista, n.d.). Nonetheless, there are still many popular female-led channels like Jenna Marbles (YouTube, n.d.-b) and Gabbie Hanna (YouTube, n.d.-a) that have accumulated a significant subscriber count. These female-oriented channels tend to focus on personal storytelling (Grosswiler, 2012).  

The relative user-friendliness and wide range of content on YouTube could account for why the platform does not struggle with diversity like many peer production projects. Unlike a peer production project like Wikipedia, the platform does not strictly hold content creators up to a particular standard of creation outside of their community guidelines. This lack of stringency may help new creators with differing perspectives and varied life backgrounds to join the platform without opposition. Since YouTube contains many, multi-faceted communities within its massive user-base, it is possible to contain a more inclusive environment.

## Conclusion  
YouTube is a massively influential platform that has integrated the volunteer concepts of peer production, whether knowingly or not, into their framework. It is doubtful that the platform could have survived if the website’s contributors did not primarily consist of volunteers. While sharing some minor similarities, YouTube’s governance, collaboration infrastructure, and potential for fame and fortune are starkly different than most peer production projects. Nonetheless, peer production’s core tenets of openness to contribution and volunteer-heavy creation is foundational to YouTube’s success.

### Interview Transcript with Luke Harwerth from the YouTube Channel “TwinSauce”  

Grant: When you first started uploading videos to YouTube, did you feel like there was a learning curve or a barrier to contributing?

Luke: The learning curve is the best part of the YouTube adventure. There are so many questions that come crashing down on a creator as soon as they set up their account. Questions like: what camera should I get? How do I edit video? What is the algorithm? Why do some videos get more traction than others? How do I get more views and subscribers? Should I sell my soul to this industry?

This can be a barrier, but it can also be fuel. We watched so many “YouTubers” that loved what they did and had fun doing it. Back then, it wasn’t about making perfectly cinematic stuff. It was about making mistakes and having fun. We wanted to do that same thing.

When we first started uploading videos, we didn’t have any expectations. Throughout junior high and high school, we loved making sketch and music videos with our family and friends. We didn’t start uploading until college, which is where we got serious about it. Honestly, we were there to have fun. The only thing we knew when we started was the little bit of experience we had from our past, and the dreams of fame and fortune that we heard other “YouTubers” claiming. The learning curve became the mission: How do I make it on this platform? We are still trying to figure out 6 years later.

Grant: What was your motivation for uploading your first video? How has your motivations changed as you continued to upload videos?

Luke: In the beginning, YouTube was a place we went to have fun, laugh, and get to know virtual communities of people who were interested in similar things. The motivation for our first upload came after discovering a creator by the name of Tessa Violet. She was incredible, creative, and made professional looking videos as a young adult. Despite not having any film school experience, she was crushing it!

At this point, Paul [Luke’s brother and co-creator of TwinSauce] had been making videos for different companies as well as wedding photography. We had a DSLR camera that had the capability of shooting HD video. I remember Paul telling me, “she can do it, why can’t we?”

Tessa Violet reintroduced a passion from high school. She also gave us the confidence to start by realizing that the best way to learn is by doing it yourself. It is a terrible idea to wait until you’re a professional to start. Our motivation was to learn and have fun while doing it. We did just that.

After a few years of uploading, the pressure to “make it” grew with the promise of fame and fortune. Unfortunately, that becomes the motivation for many creators – including us. And it still is to some extent. The older we get, the more we desire to make this our livelihood, which is very difficult when you’re not Logan or Jake Paul [popular YouTube creators].

Grant: As a regular contributor to YouTube, do you feel like you are connected to a community?

Luke: Yes. That’s the only way to do it. Most of my best friends have been made through various communities that we have been involved in on YouTube.

Having people that support you, and contribute to your content not only encourages you to keep going, but it also helps you refine your skills as a filmmaker and influencer. It is so important to surround yourself with people who are better than you – not only as filmmakers, but as intellectuals. The last two summers, we have had the opportunity to go to the world’s largest YouTube gathering: Vidcon. There we met people that we had only known online. We also had the opportunity to meet new friends and join new communities. It is after those events that we realize how important communities are. People need connection through community. For many young people, YouTube has done just that.

We have found “our people” on the internet, and we talk to them on a weekly basis through our live-stream. Every week they have pushed us to be the best we can be.

Grant: How would you describe YouTube's management style in regards to content creators?

Luke: YouTube is a company. They have to run the business the best way they can. Unfortunately, like any management, they can hurt the “employees” in the way they manage. Their management style is closest to the “autocratic style” of management. Meaning the management makes the decisions without the involvement of the “employees”. The decisions are made and finalized with money at the forefront of their mind. YouTube’s disconnected management style has become a popular joke amongst YouTube creators. Many people have protested and questioned their process, but nothing changes.

I must also mention that YouTube does occasionally request feedback on their Twitter, but most of the suggestions given are ignored. So there could be an argument made for “paternalistic” management style but I wouldn’t go that far.

Grant: Do you feel like you have any relationship with YouTube's management?

Luke: No. As a channel with less than 100,000 subscribers, it would be very shocking for us to have any kind of relationship with YouTube’s management.

As I said earlier, they are a company, and money is the name of the game. We respect that. There is no way it would be easy to run a company like YouTube. They are trying, and they have to. It would only take one video hosting website to take them down and competitors like Twitch are trying to do just that.

We owe a lot to YouTube. Many of my closest friends have come from that platform. We are very thankful for the ability to make and share videos directly with an audience that have subscribed to us and values our content. It has given us hope, and the ability to dream that we could have a company that makes videos that we want to make. We haven’t “made it” yet, but we’re more interested in having fun and building community than building an empire.
