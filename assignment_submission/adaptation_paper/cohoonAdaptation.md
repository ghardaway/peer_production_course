# Academic Research as an Instance of Peer Production
#### Hannah Cohoon


If academic research is an example of peer production, what does that imply?

Peer production is the decentralized collaboration of non-collocated volunteers working to create a product (Crowston, Wei, Howison, & Wiggins, 2012). Examples of the organizational model transcend industry and domain, though many of the most commonly discussed examples of peer production are from open source software. For instance, Apache, the world’s most popular web server (“December 2017 Web Server Survey | Netcraft,” 2017), is one of the most studied examples of peer production. Other prominent examples include the Linux operating system and Mozilla’s many products (Hertel, Niedner, & Herrmann, 2003; Mockus, Fielding, & Herbsleb, 2002). As key instances of peer production, these projects exemplify the organizational model and set expectations for peer production projects in other domains.

Open source peer production has been the object of significant inquiry (see Crowston et al., 2012 for a summary). While additional defining attributes have been identified (O’Mahony, 2007), Benkler provides a succinct definition of peer production through three characteristics: “(a) decentralization of conception and execution of problems and solutions, (b) diverse motivations, and (c) separation of governance from property and contract” (2016, p. 22).

In this essay, I will describe open source peer production through the lens of Benkler’s three characteristics. While covering each point, I will argue that in many respects academic research has these same properties and can therefore be viewed as an example of peer production. Academic research demonstrates similar decentralization, diversity of motives, and communal ownership of products to peer production. These similarities, I will suggest, invite questions about those situations in which academic research does not abide by the peer production model.

### Decentralization of conception and execution of problems and solutions
Benkler (2016) and others (Crowston et al., 2012; O’Mahony, 2007) argue that a major characteristic and innovation of peer production is the decentralization of problem conception and solution execution. This means that individuals take responsibility for identifying issues or areas of growth and, independently, individuals take responsibility for resolving those issues and improving the product.

#### Open source peer production
In open source peer production communities, users volunteer their time and skills to produce and maintain a piece of software. By sharing code through source control repositories, the communities disseminate their work . Without traditional coordination mechanisms like detailed scheduling or supervisors, autonomous participants self-assign work and build the product in successive layers through a process referred to as open superposition (Howison & Crowston, 2014; Levine & Prietula, 2014; Mockus et al., 2002). In open superposition, participants independently address small tasks. Through iterative improvements to the code, developers avoid the need for long-term planning and reduce the work necessary to address complex problems (Howison & Crowston, 2014).

Those developers most engaged in the project make up what is referred to as the “core” team of the peer production community (Aberdour, 2007). This level of involvement leads core developers to adopt administrative roles and exercise quality control by reviewing incoming code contributions (Aberdour, 2007; Crowston et al., 2012). Crucially, however, the core team does not assign work to other volunteers. Instead, bugs and feature improvements may be identified by any participant through tools like issue trackers or mailing lists (Ahern et al., 2013). This style of organization accommodates the diverse schedules, skills, and interests of participants who engage with the project regardless of their frequency of contribution.

#### Academic research
Fundamentally, knowledge production in academia may be seen as a two part process involving not only the generation of new knowledge but also the act of communicating it (Gibbons et al., 1994). Participants in this domain, as in open source peer production, are non-collocated and work asynchronously to create a product (i.e. knowledge) that other participants and observers may use. Academic researchers most often communicate their work by publishing in journals (Swan, 2006).

To create knowledge, academic researchers conceive of and pursue answers to questions relevant to their domain. Just as in open source peer production, researchers autonomously decide which projects to pursue as they engage in knowledge production.

Researchers may be part of a hierarchy within their department, but this hierarchy does not determine who addresses which research questions. Outside of the structure of universities, researchers may organize themselves by domain, joining professional organizations or interest groups. These groups and organizations, however, again have no authority to assign work to members. Instead, responsibility for identifying research questions falls on the individuals.

Parallel to open superposition, researchers develop lines of inquiry iteratively. Assistant Professor Jakki Bailey describes this process for advancing knowledge on a particular topic:

> “It’s kind of a step process where sometimes there are some basic questions that you need to
> answer before you can begin to address the more complicated ones.”

The commonplace practice of researchers concluding their publications with proposals for future directions (Swales, 1990) mirrors open source peer production’s use of issue trackers and provides a public record of this iterative behavior. As researchers publish their new knowledge, this prompts additional questions that can only be answered by building on established knowledge. Bailey describes her own iterative process, implying that a step-by-step approach is not only convenient but necessary:

> “It’s about looking at, ‘What have I learned from the previous project?’ Maybe there are some
> questions that came up that weren’t there before or maybe there are questions I’d like to
> answer but I wasn’t able to do it in this particular way because I didn’t want to put too much
> in the project at one time because then it makes it a little less clear about what’s going on.”

While in open source peer production a core team of developers is responsible for quality control, in the academic realm different mechanisms are used. Peer review—“the only widely accepted method for research validation,” (“What is peer review?,” n.d.)—requires that researchers evaluate one another’s’ work to ensure the trustworthiness of the new knowledge reported and the clarity of its communication. Like in open source development, this form of quality control is executed by volunteer participants who have engaged in the same work as those making the new contributions.

To summarize, academic researchers’ iterative and autonomous behaviors, critiqued by their peers, reflects the same patterns of behavior in open source peer production.

### Diverse motivations
Benkler (2016) asserts that—unlike other forms of decentralized production like online labor markets—peer production allows for more diverse participation motives.

#### Open source peer production
Open source peer production participants’ motivations are varied and include intrinsic motivations like enjoyment and extrinsic motivations such as intellectual gain, career advancement, use-value, reciprocity, and monetary motives (Crowston et al., 2012; Levine & Prietula, 2014; Roberts, Hann, & Slaughter, 2006; Shah, 2006). Over time, those motives might shift. Interviews with open source peer production participants suggest that hobbyists are more likely to sustain their contributions and undertake most of the critical maintenance work (Shah, 2006).

#### Academic research
Just as in peer production, scholars’ motives for pursuing academic research are both intrinsic and extrinsic. Some researchers are intrinsically motivated by enjoyment of the activity (Assessing the future landscape of scholarly communication, 2010) or their interest in developing new knowledge (Edwards, Bexley, & Richardson, 2011). Bailey describes this sentiment when she explains her own motivation for pursuing a career in academia:

> “I just decided that the people doing interesting things were the people who had PhDs…I just
> wanted to do research; I thought it was so interesting and fascinating.”

Career or reputation motives and use value are both extrinsic motivators for researchers that mirror those documented in classic peer production environments (Bietz, Baumer, & Lee, 2010; Edwards et al., 2011; Howison & Herbsleb, 2011). Some scholars argue that these extrinsic motives perpetuate lower quality research and decrease researchers’ transparency (Nosek, Spies, & Motyl, 2012).

In summary, both open source peer production and academic research engage participants driven by intrinsic and extrinsic motives. The literature suggests that these motives have a direct effect on output.

### Separation of governance from property and contract
Benkler (2016) argues that the separation of governance from property and contract is the third crucial characteristic that defines peer production. This separation means that whatever mechanisms the community uses to organize itself, the product remains collectively owned and actors remain self-directed.

#### Open source peer production
Open source peer production communities may adopt any number of governing styles. The Apache Foundation, for example, makes decisions by voting on changes (Mockus et al., 2002; Pierce, Marru, & Mattmann, 2015).  Other communities have adopted different governing mechanisms like Linux’s famed “benevolent dictator” model (Ljungberg, 2000).

Regardless of the governance model, however, participants in peer production communities retain the freedom to choose their own work and the governing body usually has no special claim of ownership over the product. In software development, open source licenses are used to limit copyright and allow modification and sharing of code (Open Source Initiative, 2007). Furthermore, even de facto ownership through specialization may be avoided by peer production communities: Mockus et al. (2002) found that while some degree of specialization did occur in the Apache web server project, most modules had multiple contributors, suggesting that, in addition to the lack of licensed ownership developers did not implicitly own even portions of code.

#### Academic research
In some respects, academic research follows the open source peer production model of separating property and participants’ contracts from the governance model. For instance, published knowledge—regardless of who produced it—is usable by any researcher and may be seen as collectively owned in that sense. However, some fundamental aspects of academic research conflict with Benkler’s third characteristic of peer production.

For example, when truly examined, the collective ownership of knowledge is revealed as fictional. Academic researchers do not share the entirety of their created knowledge in their publications for practical and personal reasons (Franco, Malhotra, & Simonovits, 2014; Nosek et al., 2012; Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011). Also, researchers are often reticent to share their data for fear of being “scooped” or losing publication opportunities (Kim & Stanton, 2016), suggesting that they believe themselves to have rights to the knowledge-in-progress that their peers do not. Finally, knowledge may be commercialized and its access limited through patents and or publication in a journal (Boggio, 2013).

Furthermore, researchers may have no true contractual obligation to pursue a given topic; pressures from different sources may imply one, however. Bailey notes, for instance, that while she has not experienced it, she knows that

> “there are some places that say, ‘You have to publish in these journals.’”

Such requirements pressure researchers to investigate topics that they expect to be interesting to a given publication outlet. Similarly, funding agencies incentivize research in particular areas by offering financial support. Additionally, faculty may be hired to a department with the expectation that they will specialize in a particular field. None of these are direct requirements placed on researchers but they do exert pressure.

Ultimately, while academic research mimics aspects of open source peer production’s standard of collective ownership and autonomous actors (regardless of governing mechanism) there are important dissimilarities as well.

### If academic research is an example of peer production, what does that imply?
As Benkler and others have shown, peer production may be characterized by its decentralization, the diverse motives of its participants, and its dissociation between governance and ownership. Drawing parallels between these defining attributes of peer production and their corollaries in academic research demonstrates how the latter may be seen as an adaptation of the former. The similarities between the two activities are not limited to those discussed above. In fact, open source peer production and academic research share some of the same collaboration infrastructure. Mailing lists and source control are common to both (Boettiger, Chamberlain, Hart, & Ram, 2015; Katz et al., 2014), though one might expect source control to be used more in open source peer production. Academic research, however, differs in some important respects from open source peer production.

Bolstered by widespread debates about the state of science production (e.g. Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012), open science advocates have noted these disparities and argue for their resolution through improved access to new knowledge via policy and technological improvements (Bartling & Friesike, 2014; Kidwell et al., 2016; Miguel et al., 2014; Nosek et al., 2012; Simmons et al., 2011). However, viewing academic research as a form of peer production suggests that open science advocates’ recommendations should not be seen as a way to bring about a new mode of research but as means to more properly align practice with expected behavior.

O’Mahony (2007) contends that communities need only conform to the pattern as a whole to be seen as peer production. Thus, it is not necessary for academic research to mimic every characteristic of open source peer production for it to be a token of the organizational model. However, recognizing it as such invokes significant questions: Do individuals have any exclusive rights to the knowledge they produce? What obligation to transparency do researchers have? Should the publishing industry do more than transfer knowledge—must it be an arbitrator of access? What role to funders or universities have in determining how research is executed and distributed? What value might there be in shifting incentives for researchers so that they are more intrinsically motivated than extrinsically? Lessons learned from open source peer production might also be applied to academic research. For example, those influences that have been identified as crucial to the success of open source peer production such as improved communication technologies (Benkler, 2016) might bear examination in the academic research context. With open source peer production as a point of comparison, these questions and possibilities might be fruitfully explored and those differences between practice and expectation might be resolved.
