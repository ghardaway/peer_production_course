# Co-operative housing governance - from silos to wikis

## 1. Co-Operative housing at ICC
The Inter-Cooperative Council (ICC) is a housing co-operative housing based in Austin providing low-cost non-profit housing for students [1]. The objectives of the non-profit also include educating and spreading the mission of co-operative governance amongst its members. The organization oversees nine independent houses (residences) spread over the west-campus neighborhood which co-operatively house its members. Austin is home to many housing co-operatives like the College Houses Co-operative [2], the La-Reunion Co-op [3] etc. [4].

Co-operatives can be seen as intentional communities with the principles of democracy, co-operation, transparency and equity at their center. Their very nature embodies peer production as a necessary activity in making them successful. This paper analyses an effort towards using a unified wiki as a cardinal source of information regarding the governance of co-operatives. Cerna [5], a member of ICC who is leading this effort shared with us his perspectives and opinions - these will inform our analysis of this peer-production effort.

### 1.1 Governance structure
ICC is a non-profit company formally called "University of Texas Inter-Cooperative Council, Inc.", the non-profit is governed by its board. The board is responsible for formulating important high-level policies, ensuring implementation of these policies, intervening as deemed necessary into house issues, collecting rent and managing non-profit finances. The board is also advised by elected members from the nine houses that ICC oversees. The board representatives from each house are responsible for representing the concerns of their house members to the board during ICC wide board meetings.

Beyond the non-profit's own governance, every individual house enjoys a very high level of house autonomy. House autonomy is a central aspect of ICC's operating policies where houses have the autonomy to formulate their own policies, manage their discretionary budgets, live and work as the house membership sees fit. The principles of house autonomy are well enshrined into ICCs bylaws that describe it as an organization [6].

### 1.2 House membership and governance
House autonomy delegates the matters of house level governance to the members of each house, the decision making within these communities are conducted in a democratic and most importantly "cooperative" way. The immense freedom awarded to every house in conducting its affairs means that every house develops its own flavor of governance and culture.

Every member of a house is expected to contribute labor hours in addition to their rent. Typically, every house has multiple officer positions for enforcing labor, liaising with the board, managing house finances, coordinating kitchen inventories etc. Officers are elected democratically and house members can hold multiple officer positions or no positions at all. House members contribute towards a well run house by doing their share of house labor and enjoy the collective benefits of living in a co-operatively run residence in return. The house manual serves as a contract amongst the membership that codifies the responsibilities of the officers and the labor hours that the membership puts in, the French House manual is one such example [7]. House meetings serve as an open and democratic venue for discussing the day to day affairs of the house as well as for proposing and voting on amends to the house manual.

House memberships are prone to constant revisions from lease period to lease period, typically lasting a semester or an academic year where new members move in as previous members move out or into other houses. The constant flux of members necessitates better mechanisms for record keeping of house level decisions and many little details involved in operating the living space e.g. lock codes, fire drill plans, previous budgets etc.
### 1.3 Peer to Peer production: An almost peer production community
Using Benkler's [8] lens to evaluate the housing cooperative as a peer production community, we see that the it does not strictly qualify as a peer producing community. The 'product' under consideration is in fact a service, which is cooperative housing. The community is not decentralized, neither in conception or in execution. It is co-located and collectively participates in both the conception and execution, defying the first of the three criterion set by Benkler. 

The membership of a house also does not harness a diverse set of motivations. The motivations of the membership converge on having a well run, non-exploitative and co-operative housing. Adding to this, the membership is collectively a part of a formal organization as member-owners of the non-profit ICC, thus the second criterion set by Benkler is also not satisfied.

Separation of governance and management from property and contract is also not fully achieved as member-owners may not own the property or the contract, which are collectively owned by all members of the non-profit. This criterion may be partially satisfied by virtue of having to share ownership of property and management with the broader membership outside the house - this is still a very weak argument. 

We see that this community fails to live up to Benkler's [8] criterion for a peer production community. On a similar note, it also fails to qualify as a peer production community in the eyes of Crowston et al [9], in their insistence on a decentralized and non-co-located community as an important hallmark of a peer production community.

This kind of community fits the scholastic characterization of a "peer to peer production" community as described by Bauwens [10]. Bauwens details the concept of peer to peer communities as Peer to Peer (P2P) Processes described the following three characteristics, all of which apply to the membership of the housing cooperative.

>P2P Processes [10]:
>- Produce use-value through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital: this is the P2P production mode, a 'third mode of production' different from for-profit or public production by state-owned enterprises. Its product is not exchange value for a market, but use-value for a community of users [10].
>- Are governed by the community of producers themselves, and not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy: this is the P2P governance mode, or 'third mode of governance' [10].
>- Make use-value freely accessible on a universal basis, through new common property regimes. This is its distribution or 'peer property mode': a 'third mode of ownership,' different from private property or public (state) property [10].

While the community as a whole may not qualify as a peer production community, we will using the terms P2P communities and peer production communities interchangeably.

### 1.4 From silos to wikis

House autonomy allows different houses to adopt and transform their governance models as per their current membership's desires. This also creates a lot of paper trail as house manuals are updated, budgets are revised, new information and processes are created etc. Every house maintains this knowledge-base in different ways and there is no way for houses to collectively share, access and use this knowledge.

Governance artifacts created by peers are confined to silos limited by the houses they are created in. Revisions cannot be easily tracked in paper and oral-history based knowledge bases, such knowledge bases are also very susceptible to information loss due to lost prints or when an experienced member leaves the house.

The move to a wiki based knowledge base for recording meeting minutes, governance artifacts and other knowledge is being piloted at ICC. This is meant to improve access to information between membership and encourage the sharing of ideas between them. The free and malleable nature of wikis lends itself well to the house autonomy that will be preserved digitally rather than as print or oral-history.

## 2. Governance as peer production
This section details the important tools and processes involved in the cooperative's governance and the generated governance artifacts.
### 2.1 House meetings and democratic processes
All houses conduct open and cooperatively managed meetings generally once every two weeks. The meeting provide a platform for membership to discuss and vote on house decisions. The details of securing majority and method of voting etc. are detailed in each house's house manual.
### 2.2 Board level governance
Governance at the board level is conducted at board meetings, general membership meetings and emergency meetings. Decisions made by the board are often communicated to each house in print, all bylaws and ICC wide policies are well documented on their website [6]. Board representatives from each house participate in discussions and vote on board level decisions.
### 2.3 Information objects and channels of governance
Multiple information objects document the discussions and decisions taken at both the house and board level. They are detailed in the following sections.
#### 2.3.1 House manuals
Every house has a house manual, the house manual serves as a written documentation of the agreed upon contract between the house members. This is usually a printed document - there are known instances of this being handwritten. The French House manual is an example of a house manual [7].
#### 2.3.2 Board packet
The board packet details the minutes and policy drafts at the board level. It is delivered in print the day after every board level meeting.
#### 2.3.3 Facebook group
Houses use Facebook groups as a means of communication and sharing of meeting minutes, new documents and general announcements.
#### 2.3.4 GroupMe or Slack
Some houses also use GroupMe or Slack for more immediate forms of communication like time sensitive announcements or chatting with members.
## 3. Achieving open governance ideals
The motivation for this project is seen in Cerna's idealism towards developing a truly cooperative and self-owned and administered space on the web for ICC. This section covers the what motivates this project for open governance.
### 3.1 Public accessibility
Having the governance details of the individual houses publicly accessible will enable people interested in cooperative living, other houses, other cooperatives etc. to look into the day to day operation of ICC houses. 

> I saw LaReunion's wiki [11], by making governance open - we empower outsiders to understand and learn about cooperation. - Cerna

Public accessibility is seen as a true step towards open governance and may help outsiders understand the cooperative community better.

### 3.2 Ownership and operation

Another motivation for an open governance model using wikis was to avoid making use of corporate communication platforms.

> Own the means of communication. Especially with the delete Facebook wave, I really feel that we must move to more self-hosted and administered solutions if we can. Which we can. - Cerna

The project is also motivated by a vision where ICC would maintain its own alternative to corporate owned channels of collaboration and retain control over its data.

### 3.3 Free as in beer

The solution or the process of open governance must be free of cost to operate and use. There must be no money involved in using the system and the system will be open to the membership to participate in.
### 3.4 Free as in speech

Another requirement is that the solution must be free from usage restrictions and any controls on how the system be used, changed or implemented. This is important because the project is not only an experiment in an idealistic interpretation of a cooperative knowledge base build ground up but also because 'libre' projects represent a similar ideal. The two interpretations of freedom discussed in this section and the one above it were coined by Stallman [12].
### 3.5 Cardinal and evolving source of information

More practical reasons for implementing a wiki based knowledge base is to keep track of the many changes that take place.

> Lot of decisions made, minutes etc. get lost with time. There is no easy way to know who lived in room 16 in the summer of 2000 or whose idea it was to plant that avocado tree. We also don't want multiple, out of sync copies of the house manual floating around or 40 PDFs on the Facebook group. - Cerna

The source would also serve as the cardinal source of all information - resolving the issue of outdated print materials which are still being used.

## 4. Replacing current systems with wiki
This section details the process and progress so far in replacing the current system with a wiki based one.
### 4.1 House level litmus test
The first place to start with a wiki based knowledge base to document the governance details openly was the French House. This test would serve as a pilot study for the feasibility of this project across all other ICC houses.

#### 4.1.1 Creation of the wiki
The wiki page is currently available for use by the membership of French House [13]. The wiki has been used to document the meeting minutes of the house since the Spring of 2018. The domain and the hosting systems are owned by Cerna on paper but are available communally in spirit.
#### 4.1.2 Licensing
All materials on the wiki pages are licensed by CC-Attribution/ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) 4.0 [14]. This was a choice made unilaterally by Cerna. 
#### 4.1.3 Technology skills within the membership
Currently the wiki is solely operated by Cerna who authors the meeting minutes in markdown and edit the pages by himself. The membership has not been trained to use this system or is privy to its details.
#### 4.1.4 Maintenance and use
The wiki is singlehandedly maintained by Cerna, it has not seen much end-user use.
### 4.2 Technical details
The wiki is a DocuWiki [15] open source software distribution hosted on Cerna's own personal hosting setup out of his room. The servers are old personal computers which expose their services on a public IP registered to the house. This setup is fairly complicated but is completely managed and resides within the house. 
## 5. Challenges
This section details the challenges that this project faces from an implementation and community participation perspective.
### 5.1 Adoption across ICC
The primary goal of this project is to eventually on-board all houses within ICC to participate in documenting their governance activities on a publicly accessible wiki. This is riddled with many challenges like weaning the membership from their current governance practices, training membership about the use of the wiki, ensuring the growth and generating buy-in and goodwill for the prject amongst the ICC membership.
### 5.2 Infrastructure fragility
The current set up of the hosting systems for the wiki are fragile considering that the whole system is being run out of Cerna's room. As the project matures we will be compelled to address the infrastructure issues that do not seem to matter at this stage. 
### 5.3 Digital shelf life
Though it is easy to create and archive digital content, digital content is also notorious for being lost, irrecoverable or destroyed. The limited shelf life of digital objects is a possible point of contention between the project and groups of membership that favor paper based methods.
### 5.4 Non-Priority issue
In the broad scheme of things, this project is on the last for items in the list of ICCs priorities.
### 5.5 Structure and templates for information
Currently the wiki does not have any structure or template since the amount and type of information varies drastically from house to house. The lack of structure may make the on-boarding to a wiki difficult for houses who are not technically inclined.
### 5.6 Benevolent dictatorship
All of the decisions regarding this project have been unilaterally driven by Cerna. He also owns the domain and the hosting setup along with the technical know how about the wiki systems. This makes him a benevolent dictator [16], which may not be received well by the ICC membership.
### 5.7 Moderating participation and access
Currently anyone can access and edit the wiki for French House, this sort of an open access and reckless edit policy will need to be discussed and moderation for access to content would be an eventual step.
## 6. Conclusion
Leading and implementing any initiative in a complex and democratically driven organization such as ICC is a very demanding task. Hopefully the membership will see the benefits of using a wiki for open governance. Menwhile, French House is slowly transitioning to making the wiki a primary source of house level governance information.
