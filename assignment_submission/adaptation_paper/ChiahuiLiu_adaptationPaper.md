## Peer Production Participation Project: Open Austin
### 1. Introduction
Open data helps us to have more transparent information concerning the government agency. Many volunteer-based organizations are trying to build a bridge between the government and the residents. For example, Open Austin, run by all volunteers, has tried to use the open data and technology to be an open government by supporting initiatives and policies to provide clearer paths for residents to engage with the government. 

Being an open government, Open Austin provides an online platform that enables residents to initiate any thoughts by open-source projects in an internal way and communicate or corporate with the government to augment the information transparency relevant to specific topics in an external way. From residents’ perspectives, Open Austin helps them using the open-sourced projects to supervise or initiate policies. On the other hand, Open Austin helps the governmental agencies to implement policies based on residents’ thoughts as well as increase the information transparency of the open data. In this paper, we focus on the open governance issues in Open Austin, and we will talk about how the organization fulfills being as an open government, and the motivations of the participants in terms of peer production.

### 2.	Barriers to contribution
Like many peer production communities, the information on Open Austin Slack is somehow overwhelmed for new participants. However, new participants can have more solid instructions for how they can contribute to the projects by checking Open Austin GitHub. Firstly, new participants are highly recommended to read through the peer production tutorials published by GitHub. After that, participants can go through all the projects on GitHub and choose any of them to contribute. If there aren’t any projects that make participants interested, they can initiate a new project based on the available open data. To me, the barriers to contributing to the projects in Open Austin is relatively easy.

### 3.	Open Governance
Benkler (2016) denotes that the decentralized task conception, the decentralized task execution, the significant social motivation, the separated governance or management from ownership, and the task structure are the five characteristics of peer production community. From internal perspectives, all the projects in Open Austin are initiated by participants, and volunteers who supervise the tasks are not participants in the projects. 

On the other hand, from external perspectives, Open Austin serves as a communication bridge between the government and the residents. To have deeper perspectives about how Open Austin serves as an open government, I joined the online discussion community of Open Austin on Slack. In the “policy” channel on Slack, participants in Open Austin share their thoughts about the open data released by the governmental agencies, and the topics can be various, ranging from politics to the environment.

Linders (2012) classifies open government into two types: citizen sourcing and government as an online platform. The former refers to residents coming up with ways to coordinate the resources, and corporate with others to provide suggestions concerning the government policies. On the contrary, the later means that the government releases a platform to let participants monitor data. From my perspective, Open Austin can be both. Firstly, Open Austin is an online platform that provides data released by the government agents and help residents visualize the data to supervise the activities and policies. Moreover, participants in Open Austin are all volunteers without any forms of rewards (Malone & Crowston, 1994). 

To learn more about the Open Austin in terms of open governance, we focus on how the organization utilizes open-sourced projects to communicate with the government and the participants. Here, I take a thread on Slack as an example, to illustrate how participants in Open Austin communicate in both external and internal ways. Matt Carey, one of the policy leads in Open Austin, communicates with the government representatives and the participants in open-sourced projects. On January 23rd, Carey posted on Slack to update the progress on getting more transparent data about carbon emissions by communicating with Lucia Athens, the city Chief Sustainability Officer, and Carey also discussed with Victoria O’Dell (shown as victoria_odell on Slack). Here is the post by Matt Carey.

“_I got an email from Lucia Athens, the city Chief Sustainability Officer, about a meeting on Feb. 8 about the request for carbon emissions data in the policy agenda. I said I'd be available to go. @victoria_odell, did you say at the library meeting that there was an environmental nonprofit interested in partnering on a project related to that kind of data? Should we try to get a representative of theirs in the meeting too?_”

Fourteen minutes later after Carey posted the update, O’Dell replied to the post to let Carey know who he should talk with to have more information.

“_Sarah Holland, the Director of CLEAN AIR Force of Central Texas has a project. I forwarded the email. An except. "We, along with the City of Austin and Travis County, have been wanting to develop an air quality app for the community to check real time air quality, receive tips on actions they can take to reduce their emissions, and be alerted of days when our air quality is expected to exceed the federal standard. "
That might be perfect. She should be at our Tuesday event for Project Champions also._” 

In the reply, O’Dell introduced the project leader, Sarah Holland, to Carey in order to help him to gather more information concerning carbon emissions data. In the meantime, there are other people provided their idea about how to get more accurate data. Here is the suggestion from David Edmonson.

“_My suggestion would be to try to get an idea of what Sarah H. might need data-wise in advance of our Feb 8 meeting…_”

Based on the threads, participants discussed back and forth to come up with a better way to communicate with the government (external) and the project leader (internal). During the conversation threads related to the carbon emissions data, it is obvious that the Carey, who supervises the project, is not the one who also participating the project. In other words, Carey is the person who supervises the project internally and communicates with the government representative. O’Dell is the person who coordinates the resources in Open Austin. Sarah Holland, who was mentioned in O’Dell’s reply, is the person who leads the project related to carbon emissions data. Thus, the governance is separated from the ownership of the project.
The aforementioned conversation is more focus on the external governance, the following part will discuss more how Open Austin coordinates internal projects smoothly. 

In addition to the conversation about how Carey communicated with people inside Open Austin to help himself figure out a way get more useful information between the supervised-level and the project-ownership level, participants also communicate on GitHub and Slack to analyze the data. In GitHub, participants create issues to discuss projects with each other, and by committing code changes with a specific statement, the project leader can keep a smooth version control. In Slack, participants share the results and discuss it with others.

Moreover, Shah (2006) points out the governance aspect in peer production community, which is decision-making rights, and the main part of the decision-making rights is the ownership rights. The code ownership rights in Open Austin are under open source license called Unlicense. According to the rights under Unlicense, “Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.” 

### 4.	Motivations
As Open Austin is a completely volunteer-based organization, what motivations drive participants to contribute is an essential element to keep the organization working smoothly. Nov (2007) points out the motivations that drive Wikipedians to contribute based on contribution level are fun, enhancement, protective, understanding, career, and values. Additionally, in open-sourced projects related to technical programming, the reasons that drive participants to have contributions are to fix bugs, to share with the community, and the employment (Lee et al., 2017). 
According to the “oa-intros” channel on Slack, a place for new participants introduce themselves and briefly talk about why they want to join Open Austin, participants join the projects for joy or concerns about specific topics. Here are some quotes from participants’ introductory posts.

“_…Especially interested in civic data projects like: helping the truly poor locate affordable rental housing…._”

“_…but I have an interest in all things technology, open source, local government, and policy._”

“_…I’m jazzed about D&I, mental health, and astrophysics. Excited to get involved here!_”

“_…wanting to get involved with civic-minded and forward-thinking projects._”

“_...we are trying to do around civil discourse starting with teens..._”

“_... Looking to support projects that make Austin a better place for everyone...._”

“_...In my professional and spare time I work on things like digital inclusion, civic engagement and civic tech, environmental issues, and a few other things..._”

As you can see these introductory posts cited from Open Austin Slack, the reason why participants join the projects is more related to their interests or concerns in specific policies, such as civic, and mental health. On the other hand, I also notice that people join Open Austin for learning new skills to switch the career path and for having more connections in Austin area. In overall, participants in Open Austin projects tend to have more interests in diverse public issues.
### 5.	Conclusions
In order to fulfill open governance, Open Austin corporates with the government agency and the lobbyists by enforcing information transparency via the results of projects. Open Austin divides the ownership and the governance of the projects and utilized the project results to help the residents supervise the government work effectively and remain to provide transparent information. Also, participants’ motivations related to public issues also play a role to make Open Austin being an open government successfully. 

Furthermore, Open Austin provides a great platform as an open government in corporation with the government agents by gathering a great number of open data. On the other hand, Open Austin also creates a friendly environment for residents who want to contribute.
