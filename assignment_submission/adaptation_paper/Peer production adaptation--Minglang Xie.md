# Peer production adaptation paper
----Minglang Xie

Peer production has been applied to many industries and areas. Wikipedia, Yelp, Amazon review, Kickstarter and Github. These volunteer-based communities allow users to participate in their construction and content revising. One by one, people introduce their friends to the community to enlarge the system and knowledge of the community. On the one hand, the expansion of the community depends on how far it can reach out. On the other hand, this depends on how open it is. Peer production to the community is a win-win strategy and process. Community gains the good branding and advertisements at the same time, users get most of the knowledge from around the world.

In this paper, I am going to discuss about peer production in tourism area. Here I introduce a peer production application named TripAdvisor, the mobile application and the website. As it was first founded by Stephen Kaufer, it focused on rating different resorts and hotels and gave recommendations to new tourists. The highlight is that it let everyone speak and comment freely. 

TripAdvisor contains many of the trademark features of a peer production community. It is a peer production product because it conforms to three important conditions of peer production: the community allows dozens of people to participate in it and not just an individual, the website is open to contribution, and these contributions lead to the production of content. A decentralized system of its database lets the website governed by main administrator at the top of the hierarchy. The main administrator delegates moderation and maintenance tasks to various lower positions. These positions include volunteer administrators and database moderators that approve or deny all changes made on the website.  
    
Like other peer production communities such as Wikipedia, one can start his or her own account and then make comments and ratings, even add new places and hotels under discussions. One of the core tenets of peer production is depending on the contributions of volunteers to effectively create, modify, or improve a project according to Tapscott & Williams in 2006. It also has a forum for open discussions among travellers. Everyone can contribute to the optimization of this website and service. The content created by travellers is perceived as highly trustworthy , credible and relevant, and up-to-date and engaging; thus, trip planners often take consumer-generated travel reviews into account during their decision-making process as the intangibility of tourism experiences makes pre-purchase trial impossible and therefore increases the need for accounts of first-person experience reports. As such, user-generated content plays an important role in influencing destination awareness and selection as well as destination brand and image creation. While there are various websites that provide traveller-generated content, TripAdvisor is the world’s largest travel content community and the most popular travel information site, empowering users to write, search, and share travel reviews. 


An actual experience is like this. If I enter its home page, I then go to the web page about a trip to Shanghai City that I’m quite familiar with. I can participate in the discussions and reviews listed under it and click “write a review” to add my comments. The system wants me to add an overall rating of the attraction/location (1 to 5 stars) and the title of the review, the purpose, the related photos. After finishing all the contents, one has to click a box to make sure this review is based on his/her own experience and is his/her genuine opinion of this establishment and that one has no personal or business relationship with this establishment, and has not been offered any incentive or payment originating from the establishment to write this review.  TripAdvisor has a zero-tolerance policy on fake reviews.

Peer production communities and adaptations involve a crossed mix of both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. When talking about the motivations of these users, I discussed with some of my friends about their experiences. At first, when they want to travel to some place far away or not familiar with, they would like to seek for help or introductions from communities like TripAdvisor. Reviews and interesting comments, photos are really helpful to them. But what drives them to write their own comments? After their travel, some different experiences make they suspicious about the accuracy of the previous comments. So, they actually try to add more ideas and comments to make the location more real and fair for new comers. According to Ryan and Deci’s paper “Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations: Classic Definitions and New Directions. Contemporary Educational Psychology” in 2000, motivations can have two main types, intrinsic and extrinsic. People are spurred to contribute to peer production systems because they have inherent interest or enjoyment or have a separable outcome. People usually have the same intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to try to contribute to and make implementations on some really famous peer production platforms like Wikipedia and Github. Although they get no cash dividends out of this, but they feel satisfied to provide useful instructions and discuss them with other users.

Peer production makes every registered member a part of the community, just like a band or strong tool of connection between both sides. I think I am really happy to be a member of TripAdvisor because I feel the responsibility to provide my real feelings and experiences to others, especially new comers. So, TripAdvisor review system is just like a positive circle, more responsible users draw more new comers and these new members will create more comments and reviews to make the community even more helpful and powerful for future new comers. This volunteer-based community is not like YouTube, which is essentially all originally produced by users. The topics in TripAdvisor are pre-determined and we can add something to it.

Coordination about working at TripAdvisor, according to Kiggundu’s paper “Task interdependence and job design” in 1983, task independence and autonomy are very important elements in peer production community. People are responsible for what they comment on someone else’s reviews and the substantive results give support to the motivating potential of initiated task interdependence.

As a public recommendation and rating website, peer production governance is also very important. TripAdvisor wishes to ensure that reviewers are not affiliated in any way with the establishment they are reviewing. Users must do not have a business or personal relationship with the owners or managers of the establishment or a competitor that might bias the reviews. In addition to being a violation of TripAdvisor’s terms of service and an unethical practice, committing fraud on reviews is also prohibited by the law and regulations in many jurisdictions. Although it is decentralized community, legal behavior is also in great need because of public relationships. TripAdvisor lets all members make public comments but comments that are illegal or inappropriate according to the platform’s community guidelines can be taken down by official administrators.

Another characteristic about peer production community is diversity. As a world-wide website and mobile application, millions of people from almost everywhere of the world participate in the community to share their different experiences and ideas about a resort, hotel or location. Wide range of contents are generated in the community every second.

Next, I will talk a little bit about the difficulties to run a community like TripAdvisor. A growing number of Web users participate in such content sharing and related online social activities, reported that 72 % of online U.S. adults use social networking sites today and more than a third of American consumers rate products/services (37 %) or post comments/reviews about products/services (32 %) online. TripAdvisor must face the challenges from other competitors and regulations from governments. According to a presentation by TripAdvisor at the Social Media in Tourism Australia Symposium, most social media traffic to travel websites comes from four sources: Facebook, TripAdvisor, Twitter, and Pinterest. Among them, TripAdvisor drives the most consumers, who spend more time on the site and view more pages. With the growing number of members and increasing contents, it is becoming harder and harder to govern and control. The probability of illegal or inappropriate contents showing up is definitely increasing. So, for TripAdvisor’s future development, how to better manage TripAdvisor’s govern system and make the administrators more efficient seem quite necessary.

Finally, there are several conclusions related to TripAdvisor and tourism here. 
• TripAdvisor’s success is inherently built on continuously adding value to its services through the expansion of its co-creation ecosystem.
• This co-creation ecosystem is also called peer production, which depends on the willingness of consumers to provide content to expand business.
• Governance, collaboration and coordination are very obvious in building the mechanism of TripAdvisor community.
• TripAdvisor’s ecosystem reflects the networked nature of tourism and therefore provides important insights for the tourism industry in terms of how innovative service provision can be structured to serve both customer and business partner needs.
• Technological innovations are key drivers for structural changes in the tourism
industry.
• Understanding the different ways in which open innovation can be structured is critical for tourism industry players in order to identify innovation opportunities.
• Because the tourism market is growing fast these years, there will be a much bigger market ahead. Although it will also be a more competitive market, it is still promising if TripAdvisor spends a lot in maintaining the accuracy and profession of its community. Try to do marketing and draw more users in the future.
